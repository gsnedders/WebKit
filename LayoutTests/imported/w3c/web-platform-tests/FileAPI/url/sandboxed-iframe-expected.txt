PASS Generated Blob URLs are unique
PASS Blob URL starts with "blob:"
PASS Blob URL starts with "blob:" for Files
PASS Origin of Blob URL matches our origin
PASS Blob URL parses correctly
PASS Origin of Blob URL matches our origin for Files
PASS Blob URLs can be used in <script> tags
FAIL Blob URLs can be used in iframes, and are treated same origin Sandbox access violation: Blocked a frame at "null" from accessing a cross-origin frame.  Both frames are sandboxed and lack the "allow-same-origin" flag.
