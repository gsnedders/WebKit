According to HTML's navigate algorithm, requests to javascript: URLs should inherit the cross-origin opener policy of the active document. To observe this, each subtest uses the following procedure.

create popup with a given COOP (the parentCOOP)
navigate the popup to a javascript: URL (the new document is expected to inherit the parentCOOP)
from the popup, create a second popup window with a given COOP (the childCOOP)
Both popup windows inspect state and report back to the test context using BroadcastChannels.
